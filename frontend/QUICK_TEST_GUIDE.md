2. **Check Network**: Developer Tools → Network tab to see API calls
3. **Check Servers**: Ensure both servers are running:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:5174`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🏁 Ready to Test!

Both frontend (5174) and backend (3000) are confirmed running. Just go to the login page and use either method above!
