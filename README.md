## üîß Development

### Test Paper Creation Workflow
Both offline and online modes follow the same core workflow:

1. **Educational Parameter Selection**:
   ```javascript
   {
     board: "CBSE",
     medium: "English", 
     standard: "Class 10",
     subject: "Mathematics"
   }
   ```

2. **Chapter Selection with Weightage**:
   ```javascript
   {
     chapters: [
       { id: 1, name: "chapter 1", weightage: 40 },
       { id: 2, name: "chapter 2", weightage: 35 },
       { id: 3, name: "chapter 3", weightage: 25 }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Pattern Selection**: Choose from predefined patterns that determine question distribution

4. **Mode-Specific Output**:
   - **Offline Mode**: Generate PDF for printing and paper-based distribution
   - **Online Mode**: Create digital MCQ test for student assignment and online participation

### Adding New Questions
Questions can be imported via CSV files with the following format:
```csv
question,a,b,c,d,correct_answer,chapter_id,difficulty_level
"What is 2+2?","3","4","5","6","b","1","easy"
"Solve: x¬≤ - 5x + 6 = 0","x=2,3","x=1,4","x=0,5","x=3,6","a","1","medium"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
